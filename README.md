Self-Assesment
  A little about me, I am a very enthusiastic and motivated new developer. I look for 
  opportunities to learn new things and challenge myself whenever possible. I might not 
  be the most experienced developer, but my hard work and drive make me competitive with 
  the best of them. I really strive to put my 100% into everything and be the best at what 
  I set my mind to. I have experience in C, C++, Java, Python, Kotlin, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  and a little bit of Ruby. This broad knowledge of program languages makes me adaptable in 
  any environment. I have focused most of my skills into creating a mobile application that 
  is on my GitHub and looking to add more projects of different talents in the near future. 
  My interest in coding began truthfully back in the days of Myspace and customizing your 
  profile with HTML, from there my interest benefited me in my career as a Welder/Machinist
  for the United States Marine Corps, with G-Code for CNC programing. These experiences, 
  along with my passion to create, really drove me to get my degree in Software Engineering 
  from Southern New Hampshire University. If you are looking for someone that really has a 
  desire to provide customers with the best possible product then feel free to contact me, 
  information can be found below.
